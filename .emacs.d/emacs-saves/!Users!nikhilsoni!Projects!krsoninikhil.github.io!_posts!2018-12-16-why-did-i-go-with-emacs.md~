I used to use Atom, it's MIT licensed, got tons of
extensions. Everything was great, life was good. Then Microsoft baught
Github. Soon enough, people started talking about [future of
Atom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17258419). Since they
already something similar called VSCode, I too started worrying about
their long term commitment to Atom. Few of my friends uses VSCode and
I'd heard and seen some very good things about it. Now that both were
owned by Microsoft, there was no reason to stick with Atom and not
give VSCode a try. So I did. It turned out great. Extension support
and community is so great that I installed extension for almost all
languages I used to write in that time. I started using it as my main
editor and kept searching for something that isn't owned by MS. I
wanted something I can trust to take it to my grave. Options were very
clear -- Vim or Emacs?

I had tried out these editors before and they require time and effort
to get used to, which I never invested. It was never Vim vs Emacs for
me. Full disclosure, during my junior year in college, I got chance to
attened a [talk by Richard
Stallman](https://geekgazette.org/2016/03/richard-stallman/) and I
already loved his work. After that talk, I tried quiting Facebook
(which I eventually did), reading about life without Google and using
Emacs as default editor. None of them actually worked out that time.

So now that I was looking for an editor, I reconsidered Emacs, until I
accidently pressed some keys (`C-x m`) and a mail client like buffer
opened up. I was already overwhelmed by it and things like these got
me off. I just wanted an editor where I can code and not a mail client
(it isn't). That day, I started setting up Vim.

Soon enough, I got used to selecting and deleting words with `ved` and
moving around line like `0` and `$`. That turned out be an irritating
poing when writing mails or anything that involves typing or editing a
little more than a word or two. That mail client looking like Emacs
buffer started to make sense now. An editor that once you get used to
will be there for you, whenever or wherever you need to type a
word. Need a [rest client](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el) or
want to write some [plain English](https://orgmode.org/), it got you
covered. Sure, Vim might also provide those things, but I moved back
to Emacs.

If you want to move to Emacs, here is my take on [easy transition
setup](/2018/12/15/easy-moving-from-vscode-to-emacs/).
