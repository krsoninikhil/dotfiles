** go-unclebob

This directory contains the template for creating a new service in
Golang along with a script to automate the generation.

** Setup

- Clone the repository and move this directory i.e. `go-unclebob` to
  your `$GOPATH/src`
- Change directory to `go-unclebob` and run:
```bash
$ go build main.go -o gobp  # gobp for go boilerplate
```

** Usage

- Create new app using:
```bash
$ ./gobp app -n appname
```
Run `dep ensure` to download dependencies.

- Create new resource in all layers of a app:
```bash
$ ./gobp resource -n resourcename -a appname
```

- Create a new function/action in a particular resource:
```bash
$ ./gobp action -n functionname -r resourcename -a appname
```

** TODO

- Create action based on HTTP methods
- Accept actions list while creating resource itself
